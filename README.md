# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machinery
A  machine learning project to classify industrial machinery failures using IBM Cloud's AutoAI, resulting in a highly accurate and deployed predictive model.

Quick Overview:-<br>
      -> Objective: To redict the specific type of equipment failure from sensor data.<br>
      -> Key Result: Achieved 99.5% accuracy in identifying failure types.<br>
      -> Core Technology: The entire ML pipeline was built and optimized automatically using IBM AutoAI.<br>
      -> Outcome: A fully developed model on IBM Cloud, ready for real-time predictions via API.<br>

Technology Stack:<br>
    1) IBM Cloud<br>
    2) Watsonx.ai Studio<br>
    3) Auto AI<br>
    4) Python<br>
